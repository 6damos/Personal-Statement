# Personal-Statement
Hi, I am Darius Amos, and I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional. Cybersecurity is constantly growing at a rapid pace with new challenges, technologies, and concepts to explore. This excites me as I am always looking to learn new things and new ways to accomplish them. I am enthusiastic and driven about information security and have strong motivations and a personal responsibility to protect people, their information, privacy, and freedoms. I want to expand my way of thinking and grow with the individuals around me, not only to achieve shared goals but to learn for the sake of exploration and knowledge itself. I am motivated by my dedication as well as a genuine enjoyment of analyzing and solving complex problems. I have a hope to continue to develop strong critical thinking skills, learn to master more tools(preferably as many as I can), and improve my communication to maximize the effectiveness of my security practices and endeavors.
